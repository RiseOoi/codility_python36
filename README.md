# codility_python36

(I will clean up the formatting of README.md later
for quick/easy linking to each problem)

In short, this repository is an unofficial solutions to lessons provided by
[codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) in pure Python 3.6.

I provide extensive comments for study. Every .py file is self contained.

---

Take note that I am using only CPython implementation for this particular repo.
Because... well... codility uses CPython 3.6.

That means, if I took advantage of some features of CPython 3.6 and
even it ended up 100% score in codility it doesn't mean it will perform
perfectly in versions/implementations other than CPython 3.6.

That means, please for Guido's sake, don't use any of these in production.
