# codility_python36

*I will clean up the formatting of README.md later for quick/easy linking to each problem*

* In short, this repository provides unofficial solutions to lessons provided by [codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) in pure Python 3.6.

* All solutions score 100% and use only the standard library.

* Also, I try to provide extensive comments and additional Python information for study and every .py file is self contained.

## How the files are structured?

Usually it's *(Lesson number numerically)*-*(Problem number alphabetically)*-*(Problem Title)*

But the *'r'* in `1r-Iterations.py` means reading section.

I recommend everyone reads the reading section before diving in.

## Notes:

Take note that I am using CPython 3.6 implementation for this particular repo
because... well... codility uses CPython 3.6.

That means, if I took advantage of some features of CPython 3.6 and
even if it ended up 100% score in codility it doesn't mean it will perform
perfectly in versions/implementations other than CPython 3.6.

That means, please for Guido's sake, don't use any of these in production.
