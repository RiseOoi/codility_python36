# codility_python36

(I will clean up the formatting of README.md later for quick/easy linking to each problem)

In short, this repository is an unofficial solutions to lessons provided by
[codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) in pure Python 3.6.

All solutions score 100% and only use the standard library.

Also, I tro to provide extensive comments for study so every .py file is self contained.

Take note that I am using only CPython implementation for this particular repo
because... well... codility uses CPython 3.6.

That means, if I took advantage of some features of CPython 3.6 and
even if it ended up 100% score in codility it doesn't mean it will perform
perfectly in versions/implementations other than CPython 3.6.

That means, please for Guido's sake, don't use any of these in production.
