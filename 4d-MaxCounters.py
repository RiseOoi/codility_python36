# You are given N counters, initially set to 0,
# and you have two possible operations on them:

# increase(X) âˆ’ counter X is increased by 1,
# max counter âˆ’ all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
# A non-empty array A of M integers is given.
# This array represents consecutive operations:

# if A[K] = X, such that 1 â‰¤ X â‰¤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
# if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

# For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

#     A[0] = 3
#     A[1] = 4
#     A[2] = 4
#     A[3] = 6
#     A[4] = 1
#     A[5] = 4
#     A[6] = 4

# the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

#     (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
#     (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
#     (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
#     (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
#     (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
#     (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
#     (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)

# The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

# Write a function:

# def solution(N, A)

# that, given an integer N and a non-empty array A consisting of M integers,
# returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

# The sequence should be returned as:

# a structure Results (in C), or
# a vector of integers (in C++), or
# a record Results (in Pascal), or
# an array of integers (in any other programming language).

# For example, given:

#     A[0] = 3
#     A[1] = 4
#     A[2] = 4
#     A[3] = 6
#     A[4] = 1
#     A[5] = 4
#     A[6] = 4

# the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.

# Assume that:

# N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].

# Complexity:

# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
# beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


# Essentially, we can separate the usual counting part and the max_counter part
# That is, we will just count as normal
# When max_counter case comes, we store the highest values
# and by resetting everything to 0, we can count as normal again
# then we just add the stored values back to the array and voila
# Note that there exist many cases of elements that were never counted
# In these "Sparse" cases, a dictionary is much recommended.

    counters = {}
    max_counter = 0
